title: The "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" approach to crisis management

As a leader, not all decisions you make will be popular. You can't please everyone, nor should you try. But you should always be able to explain your decisions and the rationale behind them - to [show your work](https://ben.balter.com/2022/02/16/leaders-show-their-work/), to those who may disagree.

One of the most frustrating responses I encounter when working with leaders who are communicating a difficult or controversial decision is the desire to shut down any dissenting voices or questions. The motivations often differ from a desire to avoid inviting negativity, fear that doing so may undermine their authority ("this is not a democracy!"), or the belief that they've already explained themselves and that any further discussion would be a waste of their time. Whatever the motivation, the underlying assumption is that the decision is correct and justified, and that challenges to it therefor must be ignorant, narrow-minded, or otherwise not worthy of engaging.

## Silencing dissent is counterproductive

In these moments of self-inflicted "crisis", it's understandable to think that the best way to shape the narrative and move forward as an organization is to silence dissenting voices. This approach is not only ineffective, it's also counterproductive. Here's why:

* **It erodes trust and credibility** - By refusing to engage with the legitimate concerns and feedback, you are signaling that you don't care about their perspectives, that you are not open to learning from them, and that you are not willing to admit or correct any mistakes. When you shut down the conversation, you send a message that you don't value the feelings of those affected, which are valid, regardless of their underlying perspective. You are also creating a culture of fear and silence, where people are afraid to speak up or ask questions, even when they have valuable insights or information that could improve the situation. This can lead to missed opportunities, wasted resources, and poor outcomes. 
* **It invites negativity** - By shutting down the channels of communication and feedback, you are not eliminating the dissenting voices, you are just driving them underground and outside of your control. You are creating a vacuum of information, where rumors, speculation, and misinformation can flourish. People will start to speculate, gossip, and complain. They will feel resentful, frustrated, and alienated. As a result, you are making your decision more controversial and contentious, not less. You are inviting more scrutiny and criticism, not less. The conversation will continue, but you will no longer be a part of it, and it will likely fester in unconstrctive negativity.
* **It stifles learning and improvement** - By avoiding or dismissing the questions and challenges that arise from your decision, you are missing out on a valuable opportunity to learn from the experience of others, to test your assumptions, to refine your arguments, and ultimately, to build a broader coalition of support.  
* **It undermines your authority** - By refusing to engage with the questions and concerns of your stakeholders, you are signaling that you are not confident in your decision, that you are not willing to defend it, and that you are not open to feedback or criticism. This undermines your authority and credibility as a leader, and it makes it harder for you to lead effectively in the future. It also makes it harder for you to hold others accountable for their decisions and actions, because you are not willing to be held accountable for your own.
   
The reality is, questions and dissenting voices are a sign that people care about the decision being made. The goal is to make the best decisions possible, and that means being open to feedback and criticism. In fact, I would argue that covering one's ears and humming in the face of questions shows a lack of leadership in the moment. So what's the alternative? How can you handle a tough decision in a way that fosters trust, positivity, and learning?

## Heading

The alternative to the "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" approach is to embrace transparency, openness, and accountability. This means acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of the situation, explaining the rationale and evidence behind your decision, inviting and addressing the questions and concerns of your stakeholders, and admitting and correcting any errors or shortcomings. This also means being humble and curious, listening and learning from others, and being willing to change your mind or course of action when warranted. This also means being clear and consistent, communicating frequently and honestly, and following through on your commitments and promises.

The answer is simple: be transparent, open, and accountable. This means:

* **Be transparent** - Share the information, the data, and the evidence that informed your decision. Explain the criteria, the trade-offs, and the implications. Acknowledge the limitations, the uncertainties, and the challenges. Don't hide, spin, or sugarcoat the facts. Be honest, clear, and consistent.
* **Be open** - Invite the questions, the feedback, and the dialogue. Listen to the concerns, the objections, and the suggestions. Respond with respect, empathy, and curiosity. Don't dismiss, deflect, or attack the views. Be receptive, humble, and collaborative.
* **Be accountable** - Take responsibility for your decision, your actions, and your results. Admit the mistakes, the failures, and the consequences. Apologize, correct, and improve. Don't blame, deny, or justify the faults. Be humble, courageous, and adaptive.

This approach may not be easy or comfortable, but it is much more effective and sustainable in the long run. It builds trust and credibility, it reduces resistance and backlash, and it fosters learning and improvement. It also shows respect and empathy, it encourages collaboration and innovation, and it inspires confidence and loyalty. It also makes you a better leader and a better person.

## Conclusion

The next time you are faced with a difficult or controversial decision, don't be tempted to pull the "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" card. Don't try to silence or ignore the questions and challenges that come your way. Don't act like the villain in a Scooby-Doo episode, who would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those mangy kids and their pesky questions. Instead, embrace the opportunity to engage, explain, and learn from your stakeholders. You'll be surprised by how much better your decision and your situation will be.
