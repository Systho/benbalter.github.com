title: The "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" approach to crisis management

As a leader, not all decisions you make will be popular. You can't please everyone, and you shouldn't try. But you should always be able to explain your decisions and the rationale behind them - to [show your work](https://ben.balter.com/2022/02/16/leaders-show-their-work/).

One of the most common and frustrating responses I encounter when working with leaders who are communicating a difficult or controversial decision is the desire to shut down any dissenting voices or questions from those affected. The motivations often differ from a desire to avoid inviting negativity, fear that doing so may undermine their authority ("this is not a democracy"), or the belief that they've already explained themselves and that any further discussion is a waste of time. Whatever the motivation, the underlying assumption is that the decision is correct and justified, and that challenge to it are ignorant, narrow-minded, or otherwise not worthy of a response.

In these moments of self-inflicted "crisis", it's understandable to think that the best way to shape the narrative and move forward is silence dissenting voices.  This approach is not only ineffective, it's also counterproductive. Here's why:

* **It erodes trust** - When you shut down the conversation, you send a message that you don't value the input, the perspective, or the feelings of those affected by your decision. You also signal that you have something to hide, or that you're not confident in your own reasoning. This undermines your credibility and your relationship with your stakeholders, who may lose faith in your judgment, your integrity, or your competence. This is a dangerous and counterproductive way of handling a crisis situation, for several reasons. First, it erodes trust and credibility. By refusing to engage with the legitimate concerns and feedback of your stakeholders, you are signaling that you don't care about their perspectives, that you are not open to learning from them, and that you are not willing to admit or correct any mistakes. You are also creating a culture of fear and silence, where people are afraid to speak up or ask questions, even when they have valuable insights or information that could improve the situation. This can lead to missed opportunities, wasted resources, and poor outcomes.
* **It invites negativity** - When you ignore the questions, you don't make them go away. You just push them underground, where they fester and grow. People will start to speculate, gossip, and complain. They will feel resentful, frustrated, and alienated. They will look for ways to resist, sabotage, or undermine your decision. They will also lose respect for you, and for the organization that allows you to act this way. it invites resistance and backlash. By shutting down the channels of communication and feedback, you are not eliminating the dissenting voices, you are just driving them underground or outside of your control. You are creating a vacuum of information and understanding, where rumors, speculation, and misinformation can flourish. You are also provoking a natural human reaction to perceived injustice and oppression, which is to rebel and resist. You are making your decision more controversial and contentious, not less. You are inviting more scrutiny and criticism, not less.
* **It stifles learning** - When you avoid the scrutiny, you miss an opportunity to improve your decision, your process, or your outcome. You don't get to hear the different perspectives, the alternative solutions, or the constructive feedback that could help you refine your thinking, address the gaps, or mitigate the risks. You also don't get to learn from your mistakes, your assumptions, or your blind spots. You end up repeating the same errors, or making new ones, without realizing it. it prevents learning and improvement. By avoiding or dismissing the questions and challenges that arise from your decision, you are missing out on a valuable opportunity to learn from your experience, to test your assumptions, to refine your arguments, and to improve your decision-making process. You are also missing out on a chance to build rapport and trust with your stakeholders, to demonstrate your competence and confidence, and to show your leadership and vision. You are also depriving yourself of the feedback and input that could help you avoid or mitigate future crises, or to seize new opportunities.

The alternative to the "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" approach is to embrace transparency, openness, and accountability. This means acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of the situation, explaining the rationale and evidence behind your decision, inviting and addressing the questions and concerns of your stakeholders, and admitting and correcting any errors or shortcomings. This also means being humble and curious, listening and learning from others, and being willing to change your mind or course of action when warranted. This also means being clear and consistent, communicating frequently and honestly, and following through on your commitments and promises.

So what's the alternative? How can you handle a tough decision in a way that fosters trust, positivity, and learning?

The answer is simple: be transparent, open, and accountable. This means:

* **Be transparent** - Share the information, the data, and the evidence that informed your decision. Explain the criteria, the trade-offs, and the implications. Acknowledge the limitations, the uncertainties, and the challenges. Don't hide, spin, or sugarcoat the facts. Be honest, clear, and consistent.
* **Be open** - Invite the questions, the feedback, and the dialogue. Listen to the concerns, the objections, and the suggestions. Respond with respect, empathy, and curiosity. Don't dismiss, deflect, or attack the views. Be receptive, humble, and collaborative.
* **Be accountable** - Take responsibility for your decision, your actions, and your results. Admit the mistakes, the failures, and the consequences. Apologize, correct, and improve. Don't blame, deny, or justify the faults. Be humble, courageous, and adaptive.

The reality is, questions and dissenting voices are a sign that people care about the decision being made. The goal is to make the best decisions possible, and that means being open to feedback and criticism.

This approach may not be easy or comfortable, but it is much more effective and sustainable in the long run. It builds trust and credibility, it reduces resistance and backlash, and it fosters learning and improvement. It also shows respect and empathy, it encourages collaboration and innovation, and it inspires confidence and loyalty. It also makes you a better leader and a better person.

The next time you are faced with a difficult or controversial decision, don't be tempted to pull the "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" card. Don't try to silence or ignore the questions and challenges that come your way. Don't act like the villain in a Scooby-Doo episode, who would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those mangy kids and their pesky questions. Instead, embrace the opportunity to engage, explain, and learn from your stakeholders. You'll be surprised by how much better your decision and your situation will be.

In fact, I would argue that covering one's ears and humming in the face of questions shows a lack of leadership in the moment.
